## AndroidStudio-Project
### Android Rudimentary Four Function Integer Calculator

## Java for Android MOOC - Vanderbilt University

In this mini-project the program logic needed to complete a simple
calculator app in Java, was developed. This app performs integer arithmetic on values entered via
components defined using Android’s user interface (or UI). We’ll supply you with skeleton
code that implements the calculator’s UI in Android. The app you implement should meet
the following requirements:

• The UI we provide allows the user to enter two integer values and to select one of four
operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division.

• After supplying the two integer values and pressing the “CALCULATE” button on the UI,
three entities will be provided to the Java code you write: the two integer values
entered by the user and the operation they selected to perform on these values.

• Your code must then perform the necessary computation and print a string that
contains the final answer in the expected form. out.print(String) is how you will display
the results to the App’s screen.

* Guidelines for source code aesthetics (such as commenting, indentation, spacing, and
identifier names).
• Creating additional helper methods as needed
• Using meaningful variable and method names
• Making the code more readable by using "white-space" and blank lines
  appropriately and
• Explaining tricky pieces of code with useful comments
